// FIXED:
// Overall game score is not updating if player 1 current score differs by 1 from player 2 current score
// 1 of the players' overall game score increases when it's a draw (no matter if the draw condition is specified in updateGameScores function or not)

  /*
  The setState method is using the functional form, which means it accepts a function as an argument. The function is called with the PREVIOUS state as its parameter. Since it's a function and not a method of the component, we don't need to use this to access the component's state.

  This approach is useful when the new state depends on the previous state to ensure we're working with the most up-to-date state values and avoid potential issues caused by relying on this.state directly.

  /* The cardDeck is extracted from the state using destructuring assignment (const { cardDeck } = this.state;). Then, setState is called with an object directly accessing cardDeck from this.state and using it to update cardDeck and currCards. However, this.state may not always reflect the most up-to-date state.

  In React, state updates may be asynchronous and batched for performance optimizations. When we call setState, React may batch multiple state updates together. This means that when we directly reference this.state to derive new state values, we may be working with stale or outdated state data.

  The tick function in World Clock exercise calls this.setState() which accepts an object of new Date() as argument. Using new Date() generates a new instance of the Date object representing the current date and time. It doesn't depend on any information from the previous state, so there is no need to access the previous state or perform calculations based on it.
